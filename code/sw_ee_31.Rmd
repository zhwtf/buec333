## Empirical Exercise 3.1

In the first question, we are asked to construct a confidence interval for the average wage. Below, I load the data and construct the 95% confidence interval.

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
#install.packages("foreign")
require(foreign)
CPS_data <- read.dta("cps92_08.dta")

# Compute average hourly earnings
Xbar <- mean(CPS_data$ahe)

# Get the SE
se_Xbar <- sqrt(var(CPS_data$ahe) / nrow(CPS_data))

# Confidence intervals
c(Xbar-1.96*se_Xbar,Xbar+1.96*se_Xbar)

# For this sample, the 95% confidence interval is given by 15.18 to 15.47.

```


## Question 4.1

Blah blah.
