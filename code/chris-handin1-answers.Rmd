## Empirical exercises 3.1

In this exercise, I am going to ...

First, I load the data into R, and compute the average hourly wages in 1992 and 2002.

```{r}
require(haven)
CPS_data <- read_dta("cps92_12.dta")

# ahe = average hourly earnings
# Average earnings for everybody in the sample
mean(CPS_data$ahe)

# Average for people in 2012
mean(CPS_data$ahe[CPS_data$year==1992])
mean(CPS_data$ahe[CPS_data$year==2012])

```

I conclude that the average hourly earnings (ahe) in 1992 are 11.62 and that they increased to 19.80 in 2012.

Next, we compute the standard deviation for ahe in 1992 and in 2012.

```{r}
s_ahe_92 <- sd(CPS_data$ahe[CPS_data$year==1992])
s_ahe_12 <- sd(CPS_data$ahe[CPS_data$year==2012])
print(c(s_ahe_92,s_ahe_12))
```

The standard deviation has also increased! We are now going to use the standard deviation to construct a confidence interval.
