## Question 1

In question 1, we are asked to compute the average wage... 

First, I will load the data.

```{r}
## Clear workspace, load packages
rm(list=ls())
require(foreign)
require(ggplot2)

## Load and inspect the data, 
wageData <- read.dta("WAGE1.DTA")
wageData$female <- as.factor(wageData$female)
#summary(wageData)
mean(wageData$wage)
```

I conclude that the average wage in this sample is 5.8961.
