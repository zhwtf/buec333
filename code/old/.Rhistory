## Q: Which variables do you think are relevant here?
##################################
## A rough look at the data. #####
##################################
# Average wage level for women is much lower than for men
mean(wageData$wage[wageData$female==1]) #select only the women
mean(wageData$wage[wageData$female==0]) #select only the men
## Q: Is this gender discrimination?
# Average education levels are lower, too
mean(wageData$educ[wageData$female==1])
mean(wageData$educ[wageData$female==0])
## Q: What does this mean?
## Q: How do you interpret the following?
mean(wageData$female==1,na.rm=TRUE)
## Q: Is it a population quantity?
# Let's graph it.
qplot(x=educ,y=lwage,col=female,data=wageData,xlab="Years of education",ylab="Log of hourly averages earnings")
# Q: Is this what you would expect if "gender" is an omitted variable?
# Q: What do you think about the role of gender in wages.

# REGRESSION APPROACH
#
# Let's use regression to answer this question.
#
# Step 1: Interpreting the coefficient in a semi-log model
model1 <- lm(lwage~educ,data=wageData)
summary(model1)
# Great, this agrees with our belief that higher levels of education
# lead to higher wages. Education is good!
#   (Note: people with higher ability (in error term) may choose
#      higher levels of education, so our result may be due to
#      omitted variable bias.)
# Interpretation of the coefficient of educ:
#   This requires an understanding of "logs", because we include
#      log of wages. We deal with this next week. For now,
#      take it from me that:
#   increasing the years of education by 1 raises the hourly wage
#   by 8%, ceteris paribus.
#
# Q: Do you believe that our estimate beta-hat is an unbiased
#       estimate/estimator for this c.p. effect?
# Step 2: Given the education level, do men earn more than women?
model2 <- lm(lwage~educ+female,data=wageData)
summary(model2)
#
# First: should we include gender dummy in the model?
#        1. Common sense/theory/background knowledge: yes
#        2. t-test: yes
#        3. Affects other variables: yes, returns to education estimate changes
#        4. R-squared rises steeply.
#
# Interpreting the results:
#        EDUC: In this model, we estimate that taking one additional year of
#              schooling increases hourly wage by 7.7 percent. This is
#              lower than before.
#        FEMALE: Ceteris paribus, women earn 36% less
