In Acconcia et al.

Mafia and Public Spending
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, American Economic Review 104(7), the authors use Italian data on 95 provinces
 (indexed by 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

) to estimate the regression coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in the model
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{i}=\beta G_{i}+\gamma X_{i}+v_{i}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the growth of per capita value added in a province 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{i}$
\end_inset

 is per capita spending on infrastructure in the same province; and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

 denotes further controls measuring the number of people reported to the
 judicial authority for (i) Mafia-type association, (ii) extortion; (iii)
 Mafia-related murders; (iv) corruption; and (v) the number of corruption
 crimes reported to the judicial authority.

For their instrumental variable strategy, the authors exploit a new anti-mafia/c
orruption policy.
 The new policy is such that, upon discovering mafia involvement, the city
 council is dismissed, and financial flows into local public works and investmen
t projects (where the mafia involvement typically occurs) is cut.
 This allows the province to have a fresh, mafia-free start.
 The instrument 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is

number of city councils dismissed in province

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do you think that 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a relevant instrument? 
\shape italic
Yes, since discovery of mafia involvement is followed by cuts in spending,
 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is expected to be affected.
 This can be checked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Convince me that 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a valid instrument.
 
\shape italic
Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 already contains a lot of information about the presence and size of mafia,
 so the instrument is only about the discovery of them.
 Many other correct answers are possible: you need to tell a story about
 the relationship between the instrument and the error term 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$

Instrumental variables II.

 Evans and Schwab (1995) studied the effects of attending a Catholic high
 school on the probability of attending college.
 For concreteness, let 
\begin_inset Formula $college$
\end_inset

 be a binary variable equal to unity if a student attends college, and zero
 otherwise.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $CathHS$
\end_inset

 be a binary variable equal to one if the student attends a Catholic high
 school.
 The multiple linear regression model is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
college=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}CathHS+other\,factors+u
\]

\end_inset

where the other factors include gender, race, family income, and parental
 education.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Why might 
\begin_inset Formula $CathHS$
\end_inset

 be correlated with 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

? 
\series bold
Catholic schools are not so different from private schools.
 Parents who make the effort of sending their kids to private schools will
 also be more likely to support their child to go to college.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Standardized test scores from the students' second year in high school are
 available.
 What can be done with this variable to improve the estimate of the causal
 effect of attending a Catholic high school? 
\series bold
Added as a control variable!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $CathRel$
\end_inset

 be a binary variable equal to one if the student is Catholic.
 Discuss the two requirements needed for this to be a valid instrumental
 variable for 
\begin_inset Formula $CathHS$
\end_inset

 in the preceding equation.
 
\series bold
It would have to be correlated with CathHS, and it should not be correlated
 with u (it should affect college only through CathHS and the other regressors.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Which one of these two requirements can be tested? 
\series bold
That it is correlated with HS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Being Catholic has a significant effect on attending a Catholic high school.
 Do you think 
\begin_inset Formula $CathRel$
\end_inset

 is a convincing instrument for 
\begin_inset Formula $CathHS$
\end_inset

? 
\series bold
That depends on what is captured by u.
 Say that a spiritual/religious background makes students more introspective
 and curious, or that this background trains your concentration through
 prayer.
 This may make it more likely that a student is interested in college, or
 that they will do well in high school.
 This is not captured by HS, and may violated the exogeneity of the instrument.
