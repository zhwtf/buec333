<br>

In this course, you will learn how to use a statistical computing environment called "R" to implement the tools you learn in this course. 

We use R, with RStudio, because it is free, and because it works on all major operating systems (OSX, Linux, Windows). 

I will demonstrate using R during the lectures, there are dedicated computer labs, and there are two hand-in assignments. This page provides additional details. 

#### Useful resources

* R can de downloaded from its [official website](http://www.r-project.org)
* A free, cross-platform, user-friendly frontend for R is RStudio. It can be downloaded [here](http://www.rstudio.com)
* You will be learning R from within R, using [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html)
* An excellent way to learn R is by studying "Introduction", "Basics", and "Linear regression" in 
    "Applied econometrics with R" by Christian Kleiber and Achim Zeileis. It is available online through the SFU library through [this link](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-77318-6/page/1)
