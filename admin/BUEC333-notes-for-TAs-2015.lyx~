Some of you have wondered which formulas that you are supposed to know for
 the final exam.
 I expect you to know all the formulas that appear in the Key Concepts throughou
t the required readings (see http://www.sfu.ca/~cmuris/2014-Summer-333/Course-sche
dule.pdf, which is now in its final version).
 Exceptions are:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The formulas in Key Concept 4.4 - Although it is not mentioned in the Key
 Concepts, I do expect you to know the formulas for the R-squared, both
 in the context of Chapter 4 and in Chapter 6 (see, for example, p.
 193) - Key concept 14.3: you only need to understand this for p=1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Furthermore, let me give you a heads-up that calculators will not be allowed
 during the exam.
 More instructions about the exam will follow closer to the day of the final.
