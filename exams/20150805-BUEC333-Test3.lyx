 the country's police force.

This problem is inspired by the study of the gender gap in top corporate
 jobs in Bertrand and Hallock (2001).

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $Female$
\end_inset

 be an indicator variable that is equal to 1 for females and to 0 for males.
 A regression of the logarithm of earnings onto 
\begin_inset Formula $Female$
\end_inset

 yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\log\left(Earnings\right)}=6.48-0.44Female
\]

\end_inset

where the estimated regression coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.44$

 has a standard error of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.05$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $-0.44$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Enumerate
Two new variables are added to the regression: 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\left(MarketValue\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $MarketValue$
\end_inset

 is a measure of firm size, in millions; and 
\begin_inset Formula $Return$
\end_inset

, the stock return, in percentage points.
 The resulting estimated regression line is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\log\left(Earnings\right)}=3.68-0.28Female+0.37\log\left(MarketValue\right)+0.004Return
\]

\end_inset

where the standard errors for the three regressors are 
\begin_inset Formula $0.04$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0.004$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.003$

 The coefficient estimate for 
\begin_inset Formula $Female$
\end_inset

 has changed from 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.44$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.28$

\begin_inset Formula $SAT$
\end_inset

 is the student's SAT score, 
\begin_inset Formula $Hsize$
\end_inset

 is the number of students in their high school graduating class (in hundreds),
 
\begin_inset Formula $Female$
\end_inset

 is a gender dummy (1 if student is female, 0 otherwise) and 
\begin_inset Formula $VisMin$
\end_inset

 and 0 otherwise.

A researcher is interested in the effect of military service on human capital.

 an instrument to estimate the effect of military service on earnings.
