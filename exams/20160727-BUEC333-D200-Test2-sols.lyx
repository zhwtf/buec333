\begin_layout Standard
From Dougherty (2011, Chapter 6, p.
 254-255).
 Using data on the educational attainment of 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1000$
\end_inset

 individuals, their score on a knowledge test, and the educational attainment
 of their parents, we estimate the following regression:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\widehat{S} & =5.42+0.13ASV+0.12SP\\
 & \phantom{=5.42-}(0.01)\phantom{SV-}\left(0.03\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is the individual's number of years of schooling, 
\begin_inset Formula $SP$
\end_inset

 is the number of years of schooling of the parents, and 
\begin_inset Formula $ASV$
\end_inset

 is the individual's score on a knowledge test (between 0 and 10).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Interpret the coefficient estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.12$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $SP$
\end_inset

.
 
\series bold
We estimate that the increase in the conditional expectation of your education
 level is higher by 0.12 years if, ceteris paribus, the education level of
 your parents goes up by 1 year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Is there sufficient statistical evidence that the education level of your
 parents has an effect on your education level? 
\series bold
Yes, the t-value is 4>2.58>1.96.
 We would reject the null of beta2=0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we estimate the regression again, but now omitting 
\begin_inset Formula $ASV.$
\end_inset

 We find that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\widehat{S} & =10.0+0.31SP.\\
 & \phantom{=5.42-}(0.03)

Is there any evidence of omitted variable bias? Explain!

Yes, there is a big change in the coefficient on SP.

Based on the results above, do you think that the relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $SP$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ASV$
\end_inset

 is positive, negative, or zero? Explain, using the formula for omitted
 variable bias.
 
\series bold
Use the OV formula.
 The bias is positive, so Cov(SP,ASV)>0.

\end_inset

Explain in words, using your answer to (4), why the coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $SP$
\end_inset

 changes from 0.31 to 0.12 when you include 
\begin_inset Formula $ASV.$
\end_inset

 
\series bold
People with more highly educated parents are more likely to score well on
 ASV, which measures underlying intelligence.
 That intelligence increase your expected education level.
 In the second regression, that effect is falsely attributed to your parents'
 education level.

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that we have data on BUEC 333 test scores 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(Y_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

, duration for which student 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 studies for the test 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(X_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

, and the major of the student 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(D_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{i}=\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
1,\text{ if economics major}\\
0\text{, if non economics major.}
\end{array}\right.
\]

\end_inset

Consider the following model:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln\left(Y_{i}\right)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{i}+\beta_{2}D_{i}+u_{i}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where Assumption 1 holds:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(u_{i}|X_{i},D_{i}\right)=0.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the score between 10 and 100.
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the duration studied in hours, between 1 and 100.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What is the interpretation (in words) of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

? 
\series bold
The expectation of your test score goes up by beta1*100% if you study for
 one additional hour, c.p.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now suppose that the OLS estimate for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 is 0.08, and its standard error is 0.04.

 Do the same test, but at the 1% significance level.
 
\series bold
t<2.58, do not reject.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we try a different model:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\ln\left(X_{i}\right)+\beta_{2}D_{i}+\beta_{3}D_{i}\ln\left(X_{i}\right)+u_{i}

\end_layout

\end_inset

 What is the interpretation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{3}$
\end_inset

 in this model? 
\series bold
This is about the unit change in the conditional expectation of test scores
 for a percentage increase in the hours studied, c.p.
 This change is higher, by 0.01*beta3, for econ majors than for non-econ
 majors.

\begin_layout Section
Chapter 12
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a famous example of instrumental variables estimation, Acemoglu, Johnson,
 and Robinson (2001, AER) estimate the effect of institutions on economic
 growth.
 They use the following model:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
GDP_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}INST_{i}+u_{i}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $GDP_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the gross domestic product of country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $INST_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a measure of the quality of the institutions in that country.
 In particular, it may measure the strength of the legal system, and how
 well property rights are protected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In this model, what does 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 capture? Give some real-world examples of quantities captured by 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 
\series bold
Other factors that influence a country's economic development.
 For example, the presence of natural resources, the health and education
 outcomes of its population, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The authors believe that 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 may be correlated with 
\begin_inset Formula $INST_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Do you agree? Explain! 
\series bold
Yes.
 Excellent institutions would help with a country's health and education
 levels, for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 is correlated with 
\begin_inset Formula $INST_{i}$
\end_inset

 , is the OLS estimator for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 unbiased? Explain! 
\series bold
It is biased, since Assumption 1 fails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The authors use an instrument 
\begin_inset Formula $MORT_{i}$
\end_inset

 that is defined as follows.
 First, they restrict the sample to former colonies, i.e.
 countries that were colonized by e.g.
 Portugal, the Netherlands, and Spain during the 15th through 18th century.
 For each of the remaining countries, they have a measurement for the proportion
 of settlers that died.
 For example, if Spain sent ships with 1000 men to Brazil, and only 700
 of those are alive after 10 years, then 
\begin_inset Formula $MORT_{i}=0.3$
\end_inset

 for Brazil.

What are the two conditions that this instrumental variable must satisfy?

It should be (i) correlated with INST, and (ii) uncorrelated with ui.

 In the model above, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $GDP$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $INST$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $MORT$
\end_inset

.
 If it is given that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
s_{XY} & =1,\\
s_{X}^{2} & =2,\\
s_{ZX} & =-1,\\
s_{ZY} & =-1.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

then what is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{1}$
\end_inset

, the OLS estimate? 
\series bold
beta1-hat = sxy / s2x = 0.5

 What is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{1}^{TSLS}$
\end_inset

? Why is it different from 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{1}$
\end_inset

? 
\series bold
beta1-hat-2sls=szy/szx=1.
 It is different from the OLS estimate because Assumption 1 is violated,
 and therefore the OLS estimate is biased.
 If the conditions in (4) hold, then the TSLS estimator is consistent.
