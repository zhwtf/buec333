Explain why this regression is likely to suffer from omitted variable bias.

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $Female$
\end_inset

 be an indicator variable that is equal to 1 for females and to 0 for males.
 A regression of the logarithm of earnings onto 
\begin_inset Formula $Female$
\end_inset

 yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\log\left(Earnings\right)}=6.48-0.44Female
\]

\end_inset

where the estimated regression coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.44$
\end_inset

 has a standard error of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.05$
\end_inset

 Explain what the 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.44$

 means.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Two new variables are added to the regression: 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\left(MarketValue\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $MarketValue$
\end_inset

 is a measure of firm size, in millions; and 
\begin_inset Formula $Return$
\end_inset

, the stock return, in percentage points.
 The resulting estimated regression line is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\log\left(Earnings\right)}=3.68-0.28Female+0.37\log\left(MarketValue\right)+0.004Return
\]

\end_inset

where the standard errors for the three regressors are 
\begin_inset Formula $0.04$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $0.004$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $0.003$

\begin_inset Formula $-0.44$

\begin_inset Formula $-0.28$

Using data on the SAT scores, personal and high school characteristic of
 4000 U.S.
 students, we estimate the following regression:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{SAT}=1028+19.30Hsize-2.19Hsize^{2}-45.09Female-169.81VisMin+62.31\times Female\times VisMin
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $SAT$
\end_inset

 is the student's SAT score, 
\begin_inset Formula $Hsize$
\end_inset

 is the number of students in their high school graduating class (in hundreds),
 
\begin_inset Formula $Female$
\end_inset

 is a gender dummy (1 if student is female, 0 otherwise) and 
\begin_inset Formula $VisMin$
\end_inset

 is a dummy variable that is 1 if the student is part of a visible minority,
 and 0 otherwise.

Can you estimate these coefficients using OLS?

Yes.
 Although it looks nonlinear, you can compute the interactions and the squares

 Remember that class size is reported in hundreds.

During the Vietnam War there was a draft, where priority for the draft was
 determined by a national lottery.

 Those with birthdates ordered first were drafter before those with birthdates
 ordered second, and so forth.) Explain how the lottery might be used as
 an instrument to estimate the effect of military service on earnings.

Evans and Schwab (1995) studied the effect of attending a Catholic high
 school on college grades (measured by 
\begin_inset Formula $college$
\end_inset

).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $CathHS$
\end_inset

 be a binary variable equal to one if the student attends a Catholic high
 school.
 The associated regression model is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
college=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}CathHS+u.
\]

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Why might 
\begin_inset Formula $CathHS$
\end_inset

 be correlated with 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

? 
\series bold
Out of many answers, here is one.
 A catholic school can be thought of as a private school.
 There are all kinds of reasons that parents that have the required resources
 send their kids to private school.
 These reasons, and the presence of resources (high-income) in the family,
 may be correlated with success in college.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $CathRel$
\end_inset

 be a binary variable equal to one if the student is Catholic.
 Discuss the requirements needed for this to be a valid instrumental variable
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $CathHS$
\end_inset

.
 
\series bold
It needs to be correlated with the event of attending a Catholic high school.
 The only effect it should have on performance in college is through attending
 a catholic highschool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Being Catholic has a significant effect on attending a Catholic high school.
 Do you think 
\begin_inset Formula $CathRel$
\end_inset

 is a convincing instrument for 
\begin_inset Formula $CathHS$
\end_inset

? Explain.
 
\series bold
Several answers are acceptable.
 If you believe that being Catholic has no effect on performance in college,
 other than through making it more likely that you attend Catholic High
 school, then it would be a good instrument.
 However, it is possible to make arguments against the validity of the instrumen
ts as well.
